      <p>We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our passion for what we make, and the people we make it for.</p>

    </div>
     <div class="text-paragraph">
      <p>We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, DJs, and many of us use Live and Push everyday. We come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us have the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.</p>
