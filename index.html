    </div>
     <div class="text-paragraph">
      <p>We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, DJs, and many of us use Live and Push everyday. We come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us have the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.</p>

          We believe it takes focus to truly create outstanding instruments.
          We only work on a few products and we strive to make them great.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their magic and grow. We've learned that achieving the best results comes from buildingteams that are richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We do not always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.
